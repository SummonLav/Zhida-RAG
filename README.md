# A Demonstration of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with a Chat Interface ðŸ’¬

This demo presents a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) model that addresses questions about Zhida Techâ€™s documents, as posted on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Observations indicate that the OpenAI GPT4o model was not trained on this specific content, leading to difficulties in providing certain document-specific answers. 

Both the modelâ€™s strengths and its limitations are highlighted and discussed.
